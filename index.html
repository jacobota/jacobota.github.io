        <h1>Hello, My name is Jacob Ota</h1>
        <h3>Aspiring Software Engineer</h3>
        <p>
          &emsp; I recently graduated with my B.S. in Computer Science from the
          University of Puget Sound (UPS). And am currently in the Masters of
          Software Engineering at Arizona State University (ASU). I actually
          switched my major to Computer Science before my junior year of
          undergrad. I instantly fell in love with it. The open-endedness,
          puzzle-solving aspect, and being able to see the final product of my
          creation not only made me proud of what I can create, but also
          challeneged me to get better and keep learning.
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp; While completing my Computer Science major within 2 years, I
          was also challenged with balancing a Resident Assistant (RA) job and
          playing collegiate baseball. Personally, I feel like this balance
          taught me a lot about how to manage my time wisely. As an RA, I was
          tasked with the care of residents, dealing with roommate conflicts,
          and how to help individuals going through tough times.
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp; As a baseball player, I learned what hardwork, adversity, and
          most importantly, what resiliency truly means. As a junior, I had a
          season ending injury that knocked me down and gave me little hope to
          getting back on the field given I had a year left and recovery was
          around 4/5 months, but through the hard work I put in through my rehab
          process I was able to come out more resilient than ever and I found
          out what I can do when I don't give up on myself.
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp; With how recent I changed to this new career path, I haven't
          truly given myself the opportunity to apply myself in any real-world
          experience with this field. However, I believe I am ready for this
          opportunity and am currently looking for an opportunity as an entry
          level software engineer to not only further my knowledge, but to gain
          professional experience in this field. Check out more of my portfolio
          with the links below.
