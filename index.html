        <h3>Aspiring Software Engineer</h3>
        <p>
          &emsp; I am an aspiring software engineer, holding a Bachelors in Software Engineering from the 
          University of Puget Sound. Currently, I am pursuing my Masters at Arizona State University, deepening 
          my knowledge and honing my skills in this dynamic field. My academic journey has been marked by 
          dedication and a passion for exploring the intricacies of software engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp; During my undergraduate years, I embraced a diverse set of roles. Not only was I a diligent 
          student through my academics, but I also took on the challenges of being a collegiate baseball player and 
          a resident assistant. The demanding schedule of a student-athlete and the responsibilities of a 
          resident assistant taught me valuable lessons in time management, teamwork, and leadership. These 
          experiences shaped not only my character but also strengthened my resolve to succeed in the face 
          of adversity.
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp; As a collegiate baseball player, I encountered numerous obstacles, yet I emerged resilient 
          and determined, showcasing my ability to thrive under pressure. My senior year stands as a testament 
          to my commitment to excellence, where I overcame challenges and achieved success on the baseball 
          field. Despite my achievements in sports and academics, I am eager to transition my skills into 
          the realm of software engineering, where I am excited to contribute and grow, translating my past 
          experiences into success in the tech industry.
