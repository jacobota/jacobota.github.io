            <p class="ms-3 fs-1 text-decoration-underline d-flex justify-content-center fw-bold" id="about-start">ABOUT ME</p>
            <p class="ms-3 fs-3">Hello, my name is Jacob Ota! I recently graduated with my B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Puget Sound (UPS). And am loooking forward to continuing my academics at Arizona State University (ASU) in the fall for my Masters in Software Engineering.</p>
            <p class="ms-3 fs-3">I actually switched my major to Computer Science before my junior year of college. I instantly fell in love with it. The puzzle-solving aspect and viewing the final product that all the projects presented to me made me not only proud of what I can create, but also challeneged me to be better and keep learning.</p>
            <p class="ms-3 fs-3">While completing my Computer Science major within 2 years, I was also challeneged with balancing a Resident Assistant (RA) job and playing collegiate level baseball. Personally, I feel like this balance taught me a lot about how to manage my time wisely. As an RA, I was tasked with the care of residents, dealing with roommate conflicts, and how to help individuals going through tough times.</p>
            <p class="ms-3 fs-3">As a baseball player, I learned what hardwork, adversity, and most importantly, what resiliency truly means. As a junior, I had a season ending injury that just about destroyed my hope for getting back on a baseball field given I had a year left and recovery was around 4 months, but through hard work through rehab I was able to come out more resilient than ever and I found out what I can do when I don't give up on myself.</p>
            <p class="ms-3 fs-3">With how recent I changed to this new career path, I haven't truly given myself the opportunity to apply myself in any real-world experience with this field. However, I believe I am ready for this opportunity and am currently looking for an opportunity as an entry level software engineer to not only further my knowledge, but to also gain some experience in this field.</p>
